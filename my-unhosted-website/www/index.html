<h2>Federated only. We are family.</h2>

Federoni is the web's first federated-only social surname. 
The Federoni family does not in itself form a social network. There is no
social
 web 2.0
 application "behind"
this page, so to speak. You cannot enter into this website and see what various Federoni family members are doing. But you can interact
with members of the Federoni family if you happen to see them on identi.ca, and on other OStatus-compliant social networks.
Since Federoni is not in itself a social network application, if you were to become a member of our family, you would need to use an
 unhosted social app to interact with others on the federated social web and operate under your Federoni identity. 
We are currently developing these, and hope to launch the necessary protocols in 
version 0.2 of the unhosted protocol stack, which will come out in October 2011. If you want to help develop this, contact 
the unhosted project on <a href="http://www.unhosted.org/">www.unhosted.org</a>. The only way to become a member of the Federoni family, 
is through your involvement (in whichever way) in the unhosted project.
