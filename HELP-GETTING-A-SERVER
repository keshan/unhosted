To get a server with apache and php, for instance, you can get a debian lenny server at rackspace.

RACKSPACE
---
Now ssh to it, and run (hitting enter to pick default options where necessary):

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

AMAZON EC2
---
You can also get a server at Amazon EC2, but it's a lot more complicated to operate. It seems there is a free tier, but it seems you cannot run Debian on there. Please edit this document if you know how to set up an EC2 server - I tried and failed to get it working.

OTHER OPTIONS
---
Although Rackspace and EC2 seem to be hard to beat, there are also other hosting providers. If you have any experience with them, please add instructions for each one here.
