======================

This code is published under the AGPL license. It's what you need to publish your own unhosted web app to the Chrome Web Store, which means it consists of:

* a 'hello world' unhosted web app which you can change to turn it into your own unhosted web app.

This code is still quite young, and should be considered 'alpha'. We welcome your suggestions
and improvements! Here's how you install it:

	for the hosted app, the hostedApp/ directory is the 'fancy bookmark' we submitted to the Chrome Web Store, to make My Favourite Sandwich available there
	for the packaged app, the packagedApp.crx file was generated from the packagedApp/ directory.

For both variants (hosted and packaged), you are encouraged to transform this example app into your own unhosted chrome web app; to upload your variant to the Chrome Web Store, following the guidelines on their site.

The packaged app is still not fully working. We are planning to also publish this app to the Mozilla Open Web Apps platform.
