Please log in to #unhosted on irc.freenode.net so we can help you get this working on your server.
======================

This code is published under the AGPL license. It's an SDK you install on a web server, and can then use to create an unhosted website, consisting of two halves:

* a 'hello world' unhosted web app which you can change to turn it into your own unhosted web app (to browse to, or as hosted or packaged browser app)
* an unhosted storage node which can function as your unhosted account provider.
 
This code is still quite young, and very much in flux. It should be considered 'alpha'. We welcome your suggestions
and improvements!

You are encouraged to transform the example app into your own unhosted web app

To install, upload this directory to a webserver and browse to it.
