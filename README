This code is published under the AGPL license. It's still quite young, and very much in flux. It should be considered 'alpha'. We welcome your suggestions
and improvements!

To install, just upload this directory to a webserver. If you don't have a webserver, then install one on your localhost. You will still be able to publish packaged apps with it.
